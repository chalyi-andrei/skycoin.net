      paragraph1: 'Skywire is the next evolutionary step in the internet’s development and use. We want to break the  chokehold that internet service providers (ISPs) have on the market by giving the power back to the  people. We are doing this by providing a decentralized community-driven mesh network where users  themselves will own and control the network’s infrastructure. Our goal is to provide everyone with access  to fast, secure, private and reliable internet.',
      paragraph2: 'It is time to leave ISPs as a relic of the past. Customers routinely have their browsing data tracked, stored  and sold by ISPs, and at the same time experience unreliable coverage and poor customer service.  Instead of relying on corporate-owned networks, the Skywire mesh network runs on widespread  user-owned nodes which come together to provide the infrastructure for the network,  allowing  communities to power their internet access.',

Relaying nodes will  only have routing information for one single prior and subsequent node for movement of the encrypted  data packet. Users will finally be able to browse with real privacy.',
