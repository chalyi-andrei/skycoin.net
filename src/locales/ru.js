To counter this, Skycoin has developed Obelisk, the new distributed consensus algorithm that solves the problems of previous generations and makes them obsolete.”',

      paragraph1: 'Obelisk is a revolutionary web-of-trust consensus algorithm built to eliminate the issues that previous generations of consensus have introduced into the blockchain space. Web-of-trust architecture creates a perfect system of checks and balances, allowing the community and other nodes the ability to audit network behavior with a high degree of accuracy.',
      paragraph2: 'With the ability to cut off suspicious nodes for malicious behavior, the network becomes stronger as trust is maintained. The quarantine of nodes can manage trust, and at the same time, this process allows the community to rebalance power in the network.',
